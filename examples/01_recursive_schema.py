    query = """Lakers defeat Warriors 124-120 in an absolute thriller! LeBron (35pts/12ast/8reb) and Curry (42pts/8ast) both went OFF but Lakers' defense came up clutch in the final minutes.
        â€¢ That block by AD on Wiggins with 45 seconds left was INSANE. Completely changed the momentum.
            â€¢ AD's defensive positioning was perfect but let's be real, Wiggins should've pump faked there
                â€¢ Kerr should've called a timeout before that possession, Warriors offense was completely stagnant
                â€¢ Nah, you want your players to play through it in crunch time. That's how you build experience.
        â€¢ Curry was absolutely cooking in the 3rd quarter. That stretch of 4 straight threes was vintage Chef
            â€¢ Yeah but where was that same energy in the 4th? Only 2 points in the final 6 minutes
                â€¢ Lakers' adjustment to put Reaves on him and double off screens worked perfectly
                    â€¢ Reaves is so underrated defensively, his footwork is elite
        â€¢ LeBron haters real quiet tonight ðŸ‘€ 35/12/8 at age 39 is ridiculous
            â€¢ Curry had better efficiency though. 42 points on 65% TS% vs LeBron's 54% TS%
                â€¢ Raw TS% doesn't tell the whole story, LeBron was creating for others and controlling pace
                    â€¢ Facts. LeBron had 12 assists to Curry's 8, and 6 of those came in clutch time
            â€¢ Both GOATs in their own right, we should appreciate watching them battle
                â€¢ Exactly, we're witnessing history. These matchups will be legendary in 20 years"""
